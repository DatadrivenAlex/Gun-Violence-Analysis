# 🔫 Gun Violence Analysis

## 📌 Project Summary
This repository explores patterns and trends in **gun violence data in the United States**.  
The analysis focuses on understanding the scale of incidents, geographic distribution, and underlying factors through exploratory data analysis, regression, clustering, and time series methods.  

The dataset includes details about gun-related incidents such as **location, date, casualties, and context**, enabling both descriptive and predictive insights.
Title: Gun Violence Analysis — From Raw Incidents to Actionable Insights

## ❓ Key Questions
- What are the **temporal trends** in gun violence incidents?  
- Which **states/regions** are most affected?  
- How do **casualty counts** vary across incidents?  
- Can regression or clustering models explain patterns in the data?  
- What predictions can be made about **future incidents**?

## 📑 Data Source
- **Type**: Public dataset of U.S. gun violence incidents  
- **Ownership**: Independent, open-source data aggregators  
- **Credibility**: Widely used for research and policy discussions  
- **Note**: The dataset reflects reported incidents and may not capture all events.

## ⚠️ Data Limitations
- **Reporting bias**: Data depends on media and law enforcement reports  
- **Granularity**: Some contextual variables may be incomplete  
- **Coverage**: Focused on U.S. incidents; may not reflect global patterns  

---

## 🧭 Ethical Considerations
- **Privacy**: Dataset excludes personal identifiers, reducing risk  
- **Sensitivity**: Gun violence is a critical and sensitive social issue; results must be communicated responsibly  
- **Policy implications**: Analyses should be interpreted cautiously to avoid misrepresentation

## 🚀 Purpose
This project demonstrates practical applications of:  
- Data wrangling and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Regression modeling  
- Clustering with K-Means  
- Time series forecasting  
- Data storytelling through notebooks and visualizations  

The goal is to extract **insights into U.S. gun violence patterns** and practice advanced **data science techniques**.
