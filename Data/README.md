# Data Directory

Place source and auxiliary datasets here.
- Do **not** commit sensitive or licensed data.
- Prefer raw data under `data/raw/` and processed under `data/processed/`.

Structure suggestion:
- `data/raw/` — original, immutable datasets
- `data/processed/` — cleaned and feature-engineered datasets
